     * TMTickEvent
     * 
     * This event is called in the {@link net.minecraft.client.Minecraft} class.
     * It can be used for calling things constantly on every tick of the game.
     * 
     * @author Tecknix Software
     */
    public class TMTickEvent extends TMEvent {
    
    }
```

### Methods:

```java
/**  
 * Post an event to the API. * * @param event Passes through the event to post.  
 * @author Tecknix Software.  
 */
 public static void post(final TMEvent event) {  
	  //Gets the content object from the map if the key matches that of this events class.  
	  final ArrayList<EventContent> contents = EVENT_REGISTRY.get(event.getClass());  
	  if (contents != null) {  
		  for (final EventContent content : contents) {  
		  	event.invoke(content);  
		  } 
	  } 
 }
